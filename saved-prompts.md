#file:web-calculator-vertical-slice-plan-enhanced.md does this plan implement all of the epics in #file:web-calculator-prd.md

propose additional features to the calculator requirements

using #file:vertical-slice-planning.instructions.md and #file:web-calculator-prd.md create an implementation plan using vertical slices

does this plan implement all the features?

add the features for v1.3, v2.0 and v3.0

create an instruction file showcasing features to stakeholders

using #file:vertical-slice-planning.instructions.md and #file:web-calculator-prd.md create an implementation plan using vertical slices

using #file:vertical-slice-planning.instructions.md and #file:web-calculator-implementation-plan.md create a prompt file, for each slice, that will implement each slice when the prompt is submitted. the prompt file contains the steps to execute not the implementation. include verifications steps that must pass. include a showcase for each slice

update the implementation plan #file:web-calculator-vertical-slice-plan-enhanced.md with a diagram that shown the dependencies between slices and what slices can be implement in parallel.

include all vertical slices 1-30 and remove the sprint and duration estimates

i don't see the diagram in the #file:web-calculator-vertical-slice-plan-enhanced.md

I see:
Comprehensive Dependency Map (All 30 Vertical Slices)
The following diagram shows dependencies and parallel implementation opportunities across all 30 vertical slices organized by phases. This visualization helps teams understand the complete project scope and maximize development efficiency.

remove the phases, treat this as a continuous stream of work. Change the diagram to a portrait orientation

remove the phases from the plan and the diagram, the plan should be a continuous stream of work.

change the diagram to landscape

shade the slices that can be implemented in parallel in the same shade of green. The ones that can't in red. choose subtle colors

the colors aren't very subtle

Create separate files for each issue for easier automation?

create a github issue for each slice

Create separate files for each issue for easier automation

remove the milestone: line from each VS-*.md file in the slices folder.

go ahead and create the issues
