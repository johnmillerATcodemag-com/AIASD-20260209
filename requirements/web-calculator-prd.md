## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack

**Frontend**:
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for accessibility
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependency for MVP (lightweight, fast)
- **Alternative**: Consider React/Vue for V1.1+ if adding complex state management

**Performance**:
- Target bundle size: <50KB (gzipped)
- Lazy load history and advanced features
- Service worker for offline support (V1.1+)

**Browser Support**:
- Modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (last 2 versions)
- Mobile browsers: iOS Safari 13+, Chrome Android 90+
- No IE11 support required

### Architecture

**Component Structure**:
```
Calculator
├── Display Component
│   ├── Expression Display
│   └── Result Display
├── Button Grid Component
│   ├── Number Buttons (0-9)
│   ├── Operator Buttons (+, -, ×, ÷)
│   ├── Function Buttons (=, C, ←, .)
│   └── Advanced Buttons (%, √, etc.) [V1.1+]
├── History Component [V1.1+]
│   ├── History List
│   └── History Controls
└── Memory Component [V1.1+]
    └── Memory Indicators
```

**State Management**:
- Current display value
- Current expression/operation stack
- Previous result
- Memory value
- Calculation history array
- Error state

**Data Flow**:
1. User input (click/keyboard) → Event handler
2. Event handler → Calculator logic
3. Calculator logic → State update
4. State update → UI re-render

### Calculation Engine

**Requirements**:
- Accurate floating-point arithmetic (use Decimal.js or similar for precision)
- Proper order of operations parser
- Expression validation
- Error handling (division by zero, overflow, invalid input)

**Algorithm Approach**:
- Use expression evaluation with operator precedence
- Consider Shunting Yard algorithm for parsing
- Maintain operation stack for chained calculations

### Data Storage

**Local Storage** (V1.1+):
- Calculation history (last 50 calculations, ~5KB)
- User preferences (theme, layout)
- Memory value (session-persistent option)

**Storage Limits**:
- Target: <100KB total localStorage usage
- Implement cleanup for old history entries

### Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**:

- UI response time: <100ms after button press
- Smooth animations: 60fps

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Minify and bundle assets
- Optimize images (SVG for icons)
- Implement code splitting for advanced features
- Use CSS containment for layout performance
- Debounce keyboard input if needed

### Security Considerations

**Input Validation**:
- Sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks
- Limit input length to prevent DoS (max 15 digits)
- Validate expression before evaluation

**Privacy**:
- No server-side calculation storage (all client-side)
- No user tracking without consent
- No third-party analytics in MVP
- Clear privacy policy for localStorage usage

**Content Security Policy**:
- Strict CSP headers to prevent XSS
- No inline JavaScript or CSS

### Layout

**Button Grid**:
```
[      Display      ]
[  7  |  8  |  9  | ÷ ]
[  4  |  5  |  6  | × ]
[  1  |  2  |  3  | - ]
[  0  |  .  |  =  | + ]
[  C  |  ←  ]
```

**Color Coding** (Suggested):
- Number buttons: Light gray (#f0f0f0)
- Operator buttons: Orange/Amber (#ff9500)
- Equals button: Green (#34c759)
- Clear/Delete: Red/Dark gray (#ff3b30 / #666)
- Display: White background, dark text (#000)

### Responsive Breakpoints

**Mobile** (320px - 767px):
- Single column layout
- Full-width buttons (stacked grid)
- Minimum 44×44px touch targets
- Display: Full width

**Tablet** (768px - 1023px):
- Two-column layout option
