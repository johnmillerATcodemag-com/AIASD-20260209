I'll create a comprehensive prompt file that will guide the creation of an evergreen software development instruction file. This prompt will cover:

1. Core evergreen software philosophy (continuous evolution, future-proofing)
2. Architecture principles for long-term maintainability
3. Code quality standards and practices
4. Dependency management strategies
5. Documentation practices (living documentation)
6. CI/CD requirements
7. Monitoring and observability
8. Security practices
9. Update and maintenance workflows
10. Team practices and culture
11. Technology currency guidelines
12. Quality gates and compliance
13. AI-assisted development integration

The prompt file will be structured to generate a complete instruction file that:
- Provides actionable, specific guidance
- Includes practical checklists
- Defines measurable compliance criteria
- Integrates with existing project instructions
- Supports both new and existing codebases

Creating the prompt file at:
`.github/prompts/create-evergreen-software-instructions.prompt.md`

Prompt file created successfully with comprehensive guidance for generating evergreen software development instructions. The prompt covers:

**Key Sections Defined:**
- Evergreen philosophy and principles
- Architecture patterns (modular, event-driven, version-tolerant)
- Code quality standards (testing, static analysis, reviews)
- Dependency management (automated updates, security scanning)
- Documentation practices (ADRs, API docs, changelogs)
- CI/CD automation (testing, deployment, rollbacks)
- Monitoring and observability (logging, tracing, metrics)
- Security practices (shift-left, scanning, secrets management)
- Maintenance workflows (updates, deprecation, hotfixes)
- Team practices (pairing, knowledge sharing, retrospectives)
- Technology currency (framework updates, best practices)
- Quality gates (coverage, reviews, security scans)
- AI-assisted development integration

**Output Format:**
The prompt specifies the exact structure for the generated instruction file, including:
- YAML front matter with applyTo scope
- Comprehensive section organization
- Compliance checklists
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Version tracking

The prompt is designed to generate an instruction file that enables long-term software maintainability and continuous relevance.
