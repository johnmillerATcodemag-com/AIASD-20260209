I'll create a comprehensive instruction file for evergreen software development practices. This will cover:

1. Philosophy and core principles of evergreen software
2. Dependency management and automated updates
3. Code freshness and modernization practices
4. Testing and quality maintenance
5. Documentation lifecycle
6. Technical debt management
7. Security maintenance
8. Automated maintenance practices
9. Monitoring and observability
10. Implementation checklists and schedules
11. Enforcement mechanisms
12. Metrics and KPIs
13. Benefits and anti-patterns
14. Gradual adoption strategy

The instruction file will be created at:
.github/instructions/evergreen-software.instructions.md

File created successfully with comprehensive coverage of:

**Core Practices**:
1. Dependency Management (automated updates, security scanning, lifecycle)
2. Code Freshness (language versions, modernization)
3. Testing and Quality (test currency, continuous validation)
4. Documentation Maintenance (living documentation, freshness indicators)
5. Technical Debt Management (proactive paydown, prevention)
6. Security Maintenance (proactive security, response protocols)
7. Automated Maintenance (CI/CD pipeline, automation hygiene)
8. Monitoring and Observability (continuous observation, proactive detection)

**Implementation Structure**:
- Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, bi-annual, and annual checklists
- Enforcement mechanisms (automated and manual)
- Metrics and KPIs with target benchmarks
- Benefits analysis (technical and business)
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Gradual adoption strategy (4-phase approach)
- Integration with existing processes
- References and resources

The file provides actionable guidance for maintaining "evergreen" software that stays continuously fresh, secure, and maintainable through proactive practices rather than reactive crisis management.
