# Web Calculator (Legacy)

> **Note**: This is an earlier iteration of the web calculator project. The current, actively maintained version is located at [calculator-web/web-calculator](../calculator-web/web-calculator/).

## Current Status

**Status**: Legacy / Reference Implementation
**Active Development**: See [calculator-web/web-calculator](../calculator-web/web-calculator/)

This project provides a basic web interface for evaluating mathematical expressions. It serves as a reference implementation but is no longer the primary development focus.

## Features

- Enter a mathematical expression
- View the evaluated result
- Basic web interface

## Migration Notice

If you're looking to work on the web calculator, please use the version at:

**[calculator-web/web-calculator](../calculator-web/web-calculator/)**

The newer version includes:

- ✅ Full service layer architecture with dependency injection
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
- ✅ Bootstrap 5.3 responsive UI
- ✅ Robust error handling with result types
- ✅ Production-ready configuration
- ✅ Complete documentation

## Getting Started (Legacy)

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK

### Running

```bash
cd web-calculator
dotnet run
```

Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (typically `http://localhost:5000` or `https://localhost:5001`).

## To Do

This legacy version needs:

- [ ] Interactive input and evaluation logic
- [ ] Improved UI
- [ ] Service layer implementation
- [ ] Test coverage

**Recommendation**: Use [calculator-web/web-calculator](../calculator-web/web-calculator/) for new development, which already has these features implemented.
