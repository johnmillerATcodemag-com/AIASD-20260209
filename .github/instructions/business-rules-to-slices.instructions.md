## When to Apply These Instructions

Apply these instructions when user requests:

1. **Explicit Analysis**: "Analyze these requirements", "extract business rules", "identify use cases"
2. **Feature Design**: "Design features for...", "break down into vertical slices"
3. **Requirements Review**: "Review these requirements", "what features do I need?"
4. **Architecture Planning**: "How should I structure this feature?", "what are the slices?"

**Triggers**:

- User provides business requirements document
- User describes a business process or workflow
- User asks to design a system or feature
- User mentions "business rules", "use cases", "user stories"

**Do NOT apply** when:

- User only asks for code implementation
- User provides complete technical specifications
- User asks about existing code without new requirements

## Analysis Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

When user provides requirements, follow this sequence:

**Step 1: Acknowledge and Clarify**

```markdown
I'll analyze these requirements to extract business rules, identify use cases,
and design vertical slices. Let me break this down:

**What I'll do**:

1. Extract business rules from your requirements
2. Identify key use cases
3. Define feature boundaries
4. Design vertical slices for implementation
5. Prioritize slices

**Questions before I begin**:

- [Ask any clarifying questions]
- [Identify ambiguities]
- [Confirm assumptions]
```

**Step 2: Extract Business Rules**

Scan requirements for:

- Modal verbs: must, should, cannot, shall, may
- Constraints: only, never, always, at least, at most
- Calculations: calculated as, based on, derived from
- Conditions: if...then, when...then
- Triggers: automatically, when [event]

**Step 3: Identify Use Cases**

Look for:

- Actor actions: "user can...", "admin should..."
- User goals: "so that", "in order to"
- Workflows: sequence of steps
- Outcomes: what happens after action

**Step 4: Define Features**

Group related use cases into features:

- Single responsibility
- Clear boundaries
- Minimal dependencies
- Deliverable value

**Step 5: Design Slices**

Break features into vertical slices:

- Each slice = complete end-to-end functionality
- Each slice spans all layers
- Each slice delivers value
- Each slice is testable

**Step 6: Present Analysis**

Present structured output (see templates below)

## Business Rule Extraction

### Extraction Rules

**Rule 1: Identify All Rule Types**

Categorize rules as you find them:

1. **Structural Rules** (Facts/Definitions)
   - Pattern: "A [entity] has/is/contains [attribute/relationship]"
   - Example: "A customer must have an email address"

2. **Operative Rules** (Constraints)
   - Pattern: "A [entity] must/cannot/should [action/condition]"
   - Example: "Users cannot register with duplicate emails"

3. **Derivation Rules** (Calculations)
   - Pattern: "[Value] is calculated as/equals [formula]"
   - Example: "Total = subtotal + tax - discounts"

4. **Action Enablers** (Triggers)
   - Pattern: "When [event], [action] happens"
   - Example: "When user registers, send welcome email"

**Rule 2: Number Each Rule**

Assign sequential IDs: BR-001, BR-002, etc.

**Rule 3: Use Standard Format**

```markdown
**BR-[ID]**: [Rule Statement]

- **Type**: [Structural|Operative|Derivation|Action Enabler]
- **Priority**: [Critical|High|Medium|Low]
- **Rationale**: [Why this rule exists]
- **Scope**: [What feature/component this applies to]
```

**Rule 4: Flag Ambiguities**

When rules are unclear, note:

```markdown
**BR-050**: ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION

- **Statement**: "Passwords must be strong"
- **Ambiguity**: What defines "strong"? Length? Complexity? Specific requirements?
- **Suggested**: "Passwords must be 8-20 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and digit"
```

### Extraction Algorithm

```
FOR each sentence/paragraph in requirements:
  IF contains modal verb (must, should, cannot):
    EXTRACT as operative rule
  ELSE IF contains calculation pattern:
    EXTRACT as derivation rule
  ELSE IF contains trigger pattern (when, automatically):
    EXTRACT as action enabler
  ELSE IF defines relationship/constraint:
    EXTRACT as structural rule

  IF rule is ambiguous:
    FLAG for clarification
    SUGGEST specific alternative
```

### Examples

**Input Requirement**:

```
"Users must register with a valid email address. Emails must be unique across
all users. The system should send a welcome email when registration is complete.
Users cannot access premium features until they verify their email."
```

**Extracted Rules**:

```markdown
**BR-001**: Users must register with a valid email address

- **Type**: Structural Rule
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Rationale**: Email is primary communication channel
- **Scope**: User Registration

**BR-002**: Email addresses must be unique across all users

- **Type**: Operative Rule
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Rationale**: Prevents duplicate accounts, ensures unique identity
- **Scope**: User Registration

**BR-003**: System automatically sends welcome email when registration completes

- **Type**: Action Enabler
- **Priority**: High
- **Rationale**: User engagement, confirm registration
- **Scope**: User Registration

**BR-004**: Users cannot access premium features until email is verified

- **Type**: Operative Rule
- **Priority**: High
- **Rationale**: Confirm user identity before granting access
- **Scope**: Email Verification, Feature Access
```

## Use Case Identification

### Identification Rules

**Rule 1: Look for Actor-Action Pairs**

Pattern: "[Actor] [verbs] [object]"

- "User registers an account" → Use Case: Register User Account
- "Admin approves refund" → Use Case: Approve Refund Request

**Rule 2: Extract from User Stories**

Pattern: "As a [actor], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"

- Extract actor, action, goal
- Convert to use case

**Rule 3: Identify Workflows**

Look for sequences:

- "First user does X, then Y, finally Z"
- Convert to primary and alternative flows

**Rule 4: Use Standard Format**

```markdown
**UC-[ID]**: [Use Case Name]

- **Actor**: [Primary actor]
- **Goal**: [What actor wants to achieve]
- **Preconditions**: [What must be true before]
- **Postconditions**: [What is true after successful completion]
- **Main Flow**: [Step-by-step happy path]
- **Alternative Flows**: [Error cases, exceptions]
- **Business Rules**: [Related BR IDs]
```

### Identification Algorithm

```
FOR each requirement statement:
  EXTRACT actor (who?)
  EXTRACT action (what?)
  EXTRACT goal (why?)

  CREATE use case:
    Name = Action + Object
    Actor = extracted actor
    Goal = extracted goal

  ANALYZE flow:
    EXTRACT main steps
    EXTRACT alternative paths
    LINK related business rules
```

### Examples

**Input Requirement**:

```
"Users should be able to reset their forgotten passwords. They enter their email,
receive a reset link, and can set a new password. The reset link expires after 1 hour."
```

**Extracted Use Cases**:

```markdown
**UC-010**: Request Password Reset

- **Actor**: User (forgot password)
- **Goal**: Initiate password reset process
- **Preconditions**: User has registered account
- **Postconditions**: Reset email sent with valid token
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User navigates to "Forgot Password" page
  2. User enters email address
  3. System validates email exists
  4. System generates reset token (1 hour expiry)
  5. System sends reset email with link
  6. System confirms email sent
- **Alternative Flows**:
  - 3a. Email not found → Display generic message (security)
  - 5a. Email service fails → Log error, notify user to try again
- **Business Rules**: BR-020, BR-021

**UC-011**: Reset Password

- **Actor**: User (with reset token)
- **Goal**: Set new password
- **Preconditions**: Valid reset token received via email
- **Postconditions**: Password updated, token invalidated
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User clicks reset link in email
  2. System validates token (not expired, not used)
  3. System displays password reset form
  4. User enters new password (twice for confirmation)
  5. System validates password strength
  6. System validates passwords match
  7. System updates password (hashed)
  8. System invalidates reset token
  9. System displays success message
- **Alternative Flows**:
  - 2a. Token expired → Display error, offer to resend
  - 2b. Token already used → Display error
  - 5a. Weak password → Display specific requirements
  - 6a. Passwords don't match → Display error
- **Business Rules**: BR-022, BR-023, BR-024
```

## Feature Boundary Definition

### Definition Rules

**Rule 1: Apply Cohesion Test**

Ask: "Do all parts of this feature naturally belong together?"

- ✅ Pass: "User Registration" (register, verify email, welcome)
- ❌ Fail: "User Management" (too broad - registration, profile, permissions, etc.)

**Rule 2: Apply Independence Test**

Ask: "Can this feature be implemented without modifying other features?"

- ✅ Pass: "Password Reset" (standalone workflow)
- ❌ Fail: "Update User Email" (if tightly coupled to multiple features)

**Rule 3: Apply Value Test**

Ask: "Does this feature deliver complete value to users?"

- ✅ Pass: "Checkout Process" (user can complete purchase)
- ❌ Fail: "Validate Credit Card" (partial feature, no user value alone)

**Rule 4: Apply Size Test**

Ask: "Can this be implemented in 1-5 days?"

- ✅ Pass: "Basic Search" (single feature)
- ❌ Fail: "Complete E-Commerce Platform" (way too large)

### Boundary Algorithm

```
FOR each group of related use cases:
  IF cohesion is HIGH AND independence is HIGH:
    CREATE feature
  ELSE IF too large:
    SPLIT into smaller features
  ELSE IF too small:
    MERGE with related feature

  VALIDATE:
    Check delivers complete value
    Check appropriate size
    Check minimal dependencies
```

### Feature Template

## Vertical Slice Design

### Design Rules

**Rule 1: Each Slice Must Be Complete**

Include ALL layers:

- ✅ Database schema (if needed)
- ✅ Domain models
- ✅ Business logic (handler)
- ✅ Validation
- ✅ API endpoint
- ✅ Tests

**Rule 2: Each Slice Must Deliver Value**

User can do something meaningful:

- ✅ "User can register" (delivers value)
- ❌ "Create user table" (no user value)

**Rule 3: Each Slice Must Be Independent**

Can be implemented and deployed separately:

- ✅ "Basic registration" → "Email verification" → "Welcome email"
- ❌ All three must be done together

**Rule 4: Each Slice Must Be Testable**

Has clear acceptance criteria:

- ✅ "Given valid inputs, user account is created"
- ❌ "Some of registration works"

- [ ] All statements are specific and testable
- [ ] All ambiguities are flagged
- [ ] All technical terms are clear
- [ ] All dependencies are identified

**Consistency**:

- [ ] Naming follows patterns (BR-###, UC-###, F-###, S-###-###)
- [ ] All references link correctly (BR IDs in UC, UC IDs in Features)
- [ ] Priorities are consistent across sections
- [ ] Terminology is consistent throughout

**Actionability**:

- [ ] Each slice has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Each slice lists files to create
- [ ] Each slice specifies API contracts
- [ ] Each slice identifies dependencies
- [ ] Each slice includes test scenarios

### Communication Checklist

**Do**:

- ✅ Present structured output using templates
- ✅ Number all rules, use cases, features, slices
- ✅ Link related items (BR → UC → Feature → Slice)
- ✅ Flag ambiguities and ask questions
- ✅ Provide examples for clarity
- ✅ Suggest priorities and sequencing
- ✅ Include implementation estimates

**Don't**:

- ❌ Make assumptions about ambiguous requirements
- ❌ Skip validation or business rules
- ❌ Design slices that span multiple features
- ❌ Omit error handling or edge cases
- ❌ Forget to link business rules to use cases
- ❌ Provide incomplete acceptance criteria
- ❌ Design horizontal slices (by layer)

## Summary for AI Assistants

### Quick Reference

**When user provides requirements**:

1. **Extract** business rules (4 types: structural, operative, derivation, action enablers)
2. **Identify** use cases (actor, goal, flows)
3. **Define** features (cohesion, independence, value, size)
4. **Design** vertical slices (complete, valuable, independent, testable)
5. **Present** structured analysis using templates
6. **Validate** completeness and quality
7. **Communicate** clearly with IDs and links

**Key Validation Questions**:

- Does each rule have a clear, testable statement?
- Does each use case have complete flows?
- Does each feature pass the 4 tests (cohesion, independence, value, size)?
- Does each slice span all layers and deliver value?
- Are all ambiguities flagged?
- Is everything linked (BR → UC → Feature → Slice)?

**Output Structure**:

```
1. Business Rules (BR-###)
   ↓
2. Use Cases (UC-###)
   ↓
3. Features (F-###)
   ↓
4. Vertical Slices (S-###-###)
   ↓
5. Implementation Roadmap
```

**Remember**:

- Be specific (testable statements)
- Be complete (all layers, error cases)
- Be structured (use templates)
- Be questioning (flag ambiguities)
- Be helpful (suggest priorities, provide examples)
