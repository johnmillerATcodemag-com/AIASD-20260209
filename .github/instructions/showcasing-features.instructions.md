# Showcasing Features to Stakeholders: A Guide

## 1. Overview

This document provides a standardized process for showcasing new features to internal and external stakeholders. The goal is to effectively communicate the value of the work, gather feedback, and ensure alignment on project direction. A well-executed feature showcase builds confidence, validates assumptions, and accelerates the feedback loop.

This process is designed to be adaptable for various contexts, from informal team check-ins to formal executive reviews.

## 2. Audience

These instructions are for anyone responsible for presenting product features, including:

- Product Managers
- Engineering Leads
- Developers
- UX/UI Designers
- Quality Assurance Leads

## 3. Key Principles

- **Focus on the "Why"**: Start with the user problem or business goal. Stakeholders care more about the value delivered than the technical details.
- **Know Your Audience**: Tailor the content and language to the audience. Executives need high-level business impact, while technical teams may want to see the architecture.
- **Tell a Story**: Frame the feature as a narrative. Describe the user's pain point, how the feature alleviates it, and the resulting benefit.
- **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Live demos are more impactful than slides. Let the feature speak for itself.
- **Prepare for Failure**: Technology can be unpredictable. Have a backup plan, such as a recorded video or screenshots, in case the live demo fails.
