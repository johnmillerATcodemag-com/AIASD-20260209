## Overview

**Slice Type:** Feature Enhancement
**Priority:** Low
**Effort:** 4 hours
**Risk:** Low
**Dependencies:** VS-10 (Memory Functions)

Extend memory functions with advanced arithmetic operations on memory values.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory operations work with all arithmetic operations
- [ ] Can perform calculations using memory values
- [ ] Memory updates correctly during chained operations
- [ ] MR followed by operation uses memory as first operand

## Technical Requirements

Enhance memory integration with calculation engine:

- Memory recall loads value for use in operations
- Operations can be performed on recalled memory values
- Memory can be stored mid-calculation

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Integrate memory with operation selection
- [ ] Test memory + operations workflow
- [ ] Update memory state during calculations
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Document memory operation workflows
