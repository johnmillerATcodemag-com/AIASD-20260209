## Overview

**Slice Type:** Feature Enhancement
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** 6 hours
**Risk:** Low
**Dependencies:** VS-03 (calculation state)

Implement memory storage functions: Memory Add (M+), Memory Subtract (M-), Memory Recall (MR), and Memory Clear (MC).

## User Story

```
As a user
I want to store values in memory
So that I can use them in later calculations
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] M+ button adds current value to memory
- [ ] M- button subtracts current value from memory
- [ ] MR button recalls memory value
- [ ] MC button clears memory
- [ ] Memory indicator shows when value stored
- [ ] Memory persists during session
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts available

## Technical Requirements

**Memory State:**

```javascript
const memoryState = {
  value: 0,
  hasValue: false,
};
```

**Memory Operations:**

- **M+ (Memory Add)**: `memory += currentValue`
- **M- (Memory Subtract)**: `memory -= currentValue`
- **MR (Memory Recall)**: Load memory value to display
- **MC (Memory Clear)**: Reset memory to 0

**UI Components:**

- Memory button group (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- Memory indicator (shows "M" when memory has value)

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create memory state variable
- [ ] Implement M+ operation
- [ ] Implement M- operation
- [ ] Implement MR operation
- [ ] Implement MC operation
- [ ] Add memory indicator UI
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Style memory buttons
- [ ] Write unit tests for all operations
- [ ] Test memory persistence during session
