# Refactoring Opportunities Analysis

What needs refactoring in the codebase?

## Inputs
Repo (source, tests, configs, build/CI), signals (file size, complexity, duplication, deprecated APIs, TODOs, lint configs)

## Exclusions
`.git/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.venv/`, `.env/`, `.cache/`, binaries

## Smell Catalog
- **Size/complexity**: Long functions, large classes/modules, deep nesting, god objects
- **Coupling**: High fan-in/out, cross-module imports, circular deps, tight UI/logic coupling
- **Duplication**: Repeated logic, copy-paste, near-duplicates
- **Naming**: Ambiguous names, mixed responsibilities, unclear boundaries
- **Error handling**: Inconsistent patterns, swallow-catch, missing context, unstructured logs
- **Testing friction**: Untestable design, static singletons, side effects in constructors
- **Performance**: N+1 calls, unnecessary re-renders, blocking I/O on hot paths
- **Deprecated/legacy**: Obsolete APIs, version straddles, pre-migration shims
- **Config drift**: Hardcoded constants, scattered env handling

## Process
1. **Inventory**: Largest files/functions, high-change areas, TODOs, key entry points/boundaries
2. **Detect smells**: Scan catalog, record evidence (file:line), note dependencies
3. **Propose refactors**: Type (extract, interface, inversion, composition, rename, dedupe, move, add tests), targets, outcome (readability/testability/reliability/performance), effort (S/M/L), risk (Low/Med/High)
4. **Prioritize**: Quick wins (S, low risk), Phase 1 (test enablers), Phase 2 (structural), Phase 3 (nice-to-have), safety net strategy
5. **Summarize**: Executive summary + durations

## Output (Markdown)

### Executive summary
2–3 sentences on maintainability and top refactor themes

### Hotspots inventory
Largest/most complex modules and risks

### Findings table
| Category | File/Target | Evidence | Impact | Refactor | Effort | Risk |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------|----------|--------|------|
| Duplication | `path:lines` | Similar in `path:lines` | Bug risk, cost | Extract shared util | S | Low |

### Refactor proposals (prioritized)
Grouped by Quick wins, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 with rationale

### Safety net and test strategy
Tests to add first for de-risking

### Sources scanned
Key files/dirs consulted

### Durations
Per-step + total

## Constraints
- Evidence-based, concrete file refs
- Prefer incremental, reversible refactors
- No code edits/network calls
